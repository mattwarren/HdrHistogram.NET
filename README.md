HdrHistogram.NET
================

A .NET port of https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram

##### Code ported so far
* Java Histograms 
* Iterators (using IEnumerable instead of Java iterators)
* All functional and performance tests
* Code is (delibrately) a line-by-line port, so it's *always* idomatic .NET code

##### Still to do
* Serialisation/deserialisaion code
* Any new commits from https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram/commits/master
* Produce sample .xls file
